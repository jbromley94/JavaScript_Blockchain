# JavaScript_Blockchain
a blockchain app to get a greater understanding of how it works

It requires npm and crypto-js so you will have to install those. 

Fairly basic.

Proof of work included, implementation of blockchain and implementation of mining and payout. With a difficulty that can be changed.
